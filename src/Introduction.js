      <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>

      <h2>1.1 Background</h2>
      <p>
        Analyzing crime data is fundamental for enhancing law enforcement strategies and ensuring public safety. As urbanization and societal changes evolve, so do crime patterns and the need for effective interventions. Advances in technology and data science now enable more sophisticated analysis, allowing for better-informed decisions and proactive measures. This dissertation focuses on leveraging Python to analyze crime data, integrating modern web technologies for data accessibility and visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UK Police API provides a valuable resource for accessing comprehensive crime data, including details about crime incidents, police forces, and neighborhood safety. By utilizing this API, we can gain insights into crime trends, patterns, and other critical metrics. The integration of APIs, such as those built with Node.js and Flask, alongside containerization technologies like Docker, ensures a robust, scalable solution for real-time data analysis and visualization.
      </p>

      <h2>1.2 Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The primary motivation for this dissertation is to develop a Python library that simplifies interaction with the UK Police API and facilitates the effective analysis of crime data. While the UK Police API offers extensive data, accessing and processing this information can be complex and cumbersome. Our goal is to streamline this process, making it easier for developers, researchers, and policymakers to retrieve, analyze, and visualize crime data.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project aims to fill the gap in available tools by offering a library that not only handles data retrieval and processing but also integrates seamlessly with modern web technologies. The motivation extends to providing a user-friendly interface and comprehensive analysis capabilities, contributing to more informed decision-making and enhancing public safety measures.
      </p>

      <h2>1.3 Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        The objectives of this dissertation are as follows:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Develop a Python Library:</strong> To create a well-structured Python library that interfaces with the UK Police API, handling data retrieval, processing, and analysis effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> To implement and deploy APIs using Node.js and Flask, providing accessible endpoints for data interaction and enabling integration with various applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Utilize Docker for Containerization:</strong> To use Docker for containerizing the API services, ensuring consistency, scalability, and ease of deployment across different environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Analysis and Visualization:</strong> To analyze crime data through the library, generating detailed visualizations and insights into crime trends, patterns, and distributions.</li>
          <li><strong>Provide User-Friendly Tools:</strong> To offer a user-friendly interface for interacting with the library, including a web-based frontend for accessing and visualizing data.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
